This report is the product of our 10th semester work as software engineers with a special in Human Computer Interaction, at the Department of Computer Science at Aalborg University.

The theme of our project is cross-device interaction between mobile devices and large displays.

In this report, we present a research paper based on a comparative study between 4 different natural user interaction techniques.

A CD containing the source code of the developed systems is supplied together with this report.
The CD also contains a digital copy of this report as well as appendices with comments, pictures and data analysis results.
Additionally, it contains all logged numbers used for the quantitative analysis, enclosed as raw experiment logs and as a SPSS data sheet.

We would like to thank Jeni Paay, Associate Professor at Aalborg University, for providing ongoing feedback and guidance throughout the project
