\begin{summary}
In this master thesis, two experimental studies were created with the purpose of comparing eight different interaction techniques allowing users to push and pull data to and from a large display using a smartphone.
The studies complements existing research in the area of cross-device data transfer between handheld devices and large displays by providing a quantitative comparison of different techniques which combines finger pointing, pointing with phones, and one- and two-handed interactions.

To perform the studies and collect data, a system was developed using a Microsoft Kinect, a large display, and a smartphone.
The studies were conducted in the usability lab and ran for four weeks with a total of 84 people participating. 

This thesis builds on knowledge gained in the authors' 9th semester pre-specialisation, and further development of the system in the 10th semester specialisation has resulted in a scientific paper presenting the studies and the results.
The paper concludes that four techniques (\pull and \push versions of the \swipe and \throw techniques) were more successful than the other four techniques (\pull and \push versions of the \grab and \tilt techniques).
Interaction designer can use our paper to understand what makes a interaction technique successful, as well as use our techniques since they have very diferent defining attributes and can be used in different situations and contexts.
