In this master thesis, an experimental study and system was developed using the Microsoft Kinect, a large display, and a smartphone, with the purpose of comparing eight different interaction techniques. 
The interaction techniques allow users to push and pull data to and from a large display using a smartphone.
This thesis builds on knowledge gained in the authors' 9th semester pre-specialisation and further development of the system has resulted in a scientific paper presenting the results.
