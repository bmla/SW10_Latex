Research into cross-device interaction techniques has been gradually increasing through out the last couple of years. 
One of the focus points of all this research is the interaction between large displays and mobile devices.
In this paper, we contribute to this body of knowledge by providing an empirical comparative study of 8 different cross-device interaction techniques: \emph{Push} and \emph{Pull} versions of \textit{Grab}, \textit{Swipe}, \textit{Throw} and \textit{Tilt}.
The goal of these techniques was to investigate the different aspects of exchanging data between mobile devices and large displays. 
We found that \emph{Push} and \emph{Pull} versions of \textit{Swipe} are both the most efficient and accurate techniques, closely followed by the \emph{Push} and \emph{Pull} versions of \textit{Throw}.
What these four techniques have in common is the ability to keep the cursor still while performing the technique.
This suggest that a large contributing factor to a successful cross device interaction technique is the ability to hold the cursor still while performing the interaction technique.
