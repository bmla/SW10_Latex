Research into cross-device interaction techniques has been gradually increasing through out the last couple of years. 
One of the focus points of all this research is the interaction between large displays and mobile devices.
In this paper, we contribute to this body of knowledge by providing an empirical comparative study of 4 different natural user interaction techniques: \textit{Grab}, \textit{Swipe}, \textit{Throw} and \textit{Tilt}.
The goal of these techniques was to investigate the different aspects of exchanging data between mobile devices and large displays. 
We found that \textit{Swipe} is both the most efficient and accurate technique, closely followed by \textit{Throw}.
What these two techniques have in common is the ability to keep the cursor still while performing the technique.
This suggest that a large contributing factor to a successful cross device interaction technique is the ability to hold the cursor still while performing the interaction technique.
