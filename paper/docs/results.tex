\section{Results}\label{sec:results}

Some data points needed to be removed from the experiments, in order to gain a clearer understanding of the data we just gathered. 


From the \target, we started with a total of 7344 attempts.
176 were removed because of system errors, were the system wrongly activated a technique attempt even though the user did not intend to do so.
Another 232 attempts were removed as outliers using the Outlier Labeling method described by Hoaglin and Iglewicz in Resistant Rules for Outlier Labeling \cite{Hoaglin:1987}.
This gave us a total of 6936 attempts for the \target.

From the \accuracy, we started with a total of 4752 attempts.
111 attempts were removed to system errors. 
Finally 130 attempts were removed with the same Outlier Labeling method used above.
This gave us a total of 4511 attempts for the \accuracy.
