\section{Future Research} \label{sec:futureresearch}
In the future, we plan on extending this research by trying to better understand the effects the number of hands has on efficiency and accuracy of each technique.
Another plan would be to create a locking mechanism and purely explore the efficiency of each technique. 
Once people no longer are afraid of missing, does that change how fast they perform each technique?
We could also add try to measure how fast people learn and master each technique, and try to see how that is affected by the number of steps a technique has, or how complex it is. 
Is there any connection to the amount of hands needed to perform a technique?

These are all experiments we could conduct with some simple extensions and modifications of our current system and would provide some very interesting answers.
