\section{Future Research} \label{sec:futureresearch}
Future work could attempt to answer the question of whether or not one handed or two handed techniques are more efficient and accurate.
Our focus has been purely on a quantitative understanding of interaction techniques: time taken, success and distance in pixels.
There are many more facets to interaction techniques than this. 
Future research could do a qualitative study on users opinion of the different techniques. 
One could also attempt to utilize each technique in a public setting since large public display are becoming more and more prevalent. 
This could lead to a better understanding of the social implications of using such techniques in a public setting.
Finally, we could explore the learning curves of each technique, to better understand the use context for each of these interaction techniques.
