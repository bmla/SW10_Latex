\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present our results from a comparative empirical study between four cross-device interaction techniques between smartphones and large displays. 
We performed two studies, comparing four significantly different interaction techniques, in order to better understand what makes an interaction technique successful and efficient. 
We show that the largest contributor to a technique's success and efficiency is the ability to hold the cursor still while performing an interaction technique.
These results further develop the understanding in creating well designed interaction techniques for cross device systems.
