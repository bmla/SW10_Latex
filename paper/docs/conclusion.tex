\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we present our results from a comparative empirical study between eight cross-device interaction techniques between smartphones and large displays. 
We performed two studies, comparing eight significantly different interaction techniques, in order to better understand what makes an interaction technique accurate and efficient. 

Our results show that \swipe and \throw were the most successful techniques out of all eight techniques. 
The one common factor between the two techniques was the fact that the gestures needed in order to perform the technique did not include movement in the cursor pointing hand.
This indicates that a large contributor to a technique's accuracy and efficiency is the ability to hold the cursor still while performing an interaction technique.

This comparative study provides a basic understanding of the different attributes that make a cross-device interaction technique between mobile devices and large displays successful in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
