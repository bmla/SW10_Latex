\section{Related work} \label{sec:relatedwork}
In this section we present related work which has been done in the area of techniques for transferring information and data between mobile devices and displays.
We also present developments within the topics of pointing in mid-air and controlling a cursor on a display at a distance.

\subsection{Large displays \& Mid-air pointing} \label{sec:largeDisplayAirPointing}
The interaction interface for large displays will most likely be either touch or mid-air pointing.
For pointing in mid-air there are different technologies such as Microsofts's new mixed reality glasses, named HoloLens. \todo{ref? don't agree}
With HoloLens, the controlling interface is hand gestures combining the physical 3D world with the virtual or augmented reality made possible with the HoloLens. \todo{Kinect? Not sure what is ment}
Using mid-air gestures can also make the physical space we move around in combine more seamlessly with what we see on a large display.
In the literature research on different approaches to pointing and controlling, for example, virtual pointers on a screen. \todo{using these technologies? does what? not sure what this sentence is aimed at.}

% This is the Off-Limits paper
Using a large display and mid-air pointing, Markussen et al. \cite{Markussen:2016} explored an interaction concept called \emph{Off-Limits} in which the user is able to interact with a large display outside the boundaries of the screen.
The results show that, for off-screen interaction, touch is slower than using mid-air techniques but participants who used mid-air would undershoot their targets.
This problem resulted in a model that corrects for undershooting thus creating a better mapping between where participants would like to point and where they actually point.
The study showed that \emph{Off-Limits} outperformed the naive implementation of an off-screen technique by being faster and requiring fewer interactions.
%Participants had to acquire a number by pointing on a horizontal line that continued beyond the screen's boundary in both directions.
%They did three studies and in the first two they were exploring the performance and how people understand off-screen space.
%For the last experiment they compared the \emph{Off-Limits} interface (which was created based on knowledge from two previous studies) with the na√Øve implementation of \emph{Off-Screen} pointing.

% Should I Stay or Should I Go
Jacobsen et al. \cite{Jakobsen:2015} explore two different interaction interfaces for large displays, namely touch and mid-air gestures.
With two experiments they aim to find out when users choose one interface over the other.
The first experiment aims to compare touch and mid-air gestures and the results showed a high error rate for both while the target selection time for mid-air was 40\% more than for touch.
Participants were given questions on subjective satisfaction and the results showed that 12 of 19 preferred touch and 7 of 19 preferred mid-air.
For the second experiment users were free to choose which interface to use and during the experiment physical movements were required to simulate circumstances where it would be necessary to move away from the screen.
The results revealed that in 42\% of the trials made, participants chose to use mid-air gestures and that for medium to large target sizes where users were asked to move to and from the display, mid-air was used more often than touch.
With 7 out of 10 participants preferring mid-air gestures for the second experiment, the cost of moving back and forth to use the touch interface would seem to make mid-air pointing preferable.

% Code Space
Bragdon et al. \cite{Bragdon:2011} created a system called Code Space to support developer meetings.
The system uses cross-device interaction techniques for people to interactively participate and contribute to meetings by using hand gestures to point at and manipulate the content on the shared screen.
They also use their handhelds and laptops to push and pull content to and from the shared screen.
Techniques for manipulating objects include mid-air finger pointing and the moving of objects and also using mid-air phone pointing to move objects on the screen.
Techniques for sharing objects include pointing with phone and swiping to push and pull objects to and from the shared display.
Another technique is transient sharing from e.g. a handheld device which is performed by holding the device's screen perpendicular with the floor to share an object.
A pilot evaluation was conducted and feedback from the participants indicated an overall positive attitude towards the system with comments such as \textit{``this is awesome'', ``cool'', ``this is Minority Report stuff, I love it'', ``everyone can participate''.}
Also, participants generally felt that the interactions were socially acceptable to perform within their team of fellow developers.

% Scroll, tilt or move it
Boring et al. experimented with using mobile phones to control a cursor on large displays and had three different interaction techniques to move the cursor.
The three techniques were \emph{Scroll} (using buttons on the phone to move pointer), \emph{Tilt} (tilting the phone to move pointer), and \emph{Move} (moving the phone in a direction to move the pointer in the same direction).
In the experiment each technique were tested and participants had to acquire a number of targets with a long or a short distances between them and with three different target sizes to hit.
Results showed that for both larger target sizes and smaller distances the selection times were lower while the fastest technique for both distance and size were \emph{Move}.
For error rates, the results show that short distances and larger target sizes reduce the error rate while the technique with lowest error rate were \emph{Scroll}.
Questionnaires showed that for general comfort there were no trend towards any single technique but \emph{Scroll} was significantly ``easier to use'' than \emph{Tilt} as participants seemed frustrated using it.

\subsubsection{Using handheld devices} \label{sec:midAirPointingHandheld}
% This one is about pointing techniques where they are using handdeld devices (both smartphones and tablests)
A study by Nancel et al. \cite{Nancel:2013} focuses on using handheld devices and high precision pointing techniques for acquiring targets on a large wall sized display.
Their implementation uses the handheld device for controlling the pointer on the large display and a small area of the handheld device is used for relative pointing.
One technique uses two fingers for coarse pointing and one finger for precision pointing. 
Another technique they use is a head-based coarse pointing technique making it possible for the participants to roughly get the pointer close to the target using their head.
They found that continuous head pointing is faster and more successful than their other techniques.
A comparison showed that their technique performed as good as some state-of-the-art techniques such as LaserGyro\cite{Vogel:2005} and SmoothPoint\cite{Gallo:2012}. 
They showed that it was in fact possible to maintain precision and ample screen real estate on the handheld device.
%The two techniques both have a discrete and a continuous mode giving a total of 4 techniques that were compared with each other and two techniques were also compared to two state-of-the-art techniques, LaserGyro (based on \cite{Vogel:2005}) and SmoothPoint \cite{Gallo:2012}.

\subsection{Techniques for transfering data \& Target acquisition} \label{sec:targetAcquisition}
Rashid et al. \cite{Rashid:2011} explore two different techniques for interacting with and acquiring targets on a large display using a handheld device.
The first technique is \emph{Proximal Selection (PS)} which pulls a selected, or zoomed-in, area of the large display onto the phone and the user is then able to select the correct target.
The second technique is \emph{Distal Selection (DS)} where the user points at the large display, zoom-ins on the selected area, and finally selects the desired target on the large display.
In their experiment they found that, for complex tasks and with regards to time, \emph{PS} outperforms \emph{DS} but for simpler tasks \emph{DS} was approximately 0.1 seconds faster but the effect was not significant.
The error rate for the techniques showed that \emph{DS} had fewer missed clicks for both small and large targets and that there was a significant difference for the small targets. \todo{meaning?}

Techniques for interacting with large displays using handheld devices such as smartphones are numerous.
Different approaches have been documented in the literature and amongst them are throw and tilt gestures for interacting with large displays.
Dachselt et al. \cite{Dachselt:2008} and Boring et al. \cite{Boring:2009} describe how a tilt technique with a handheld device can be used to control a pointer on a remote display.
In addition, Dachselt et al. describes a throwing gesture for transferring data (e.g. from a phone) to and from a large display and the application proposed also describe the concept of transferring an entire user interface between a phone and a display using the throw gesture.
\todo{what did this lead to?}
