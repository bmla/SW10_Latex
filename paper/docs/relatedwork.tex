\section{Related work} \label{sec:relatedwork}
In this section we will be present the work which has been done in the area of transferring information and data between phones and displays.
We will present the developments within the topic of pointing in mid-air and that of controlling a cursor on a display at a distance.

\subsection{Handheld and Large Display Interaction techniques} \label{sec:techniquesForTransfer}
Techniques for interacting with large displays using a handheld device such as a smartphone are numerous.
Different approaches have been documented in the literature and amongst them are \todo[inline]{insert references to those papers here}

\subsection{Mid-air pointing} \label{sec:midAirPointing}
For pointing in mid-air there are different applications such as Microsofts's new mixed reality glasses, named HoloLens.
With HoloLens, the controlling interface is hand gestures combining the physical 3D world with the virtual or augmented reality made possible with the HoloLens.
Using mid-air gestures could also make the 3D space we move around in combine more seamlessly with the what we see on a large display.
In the literature there are different approaches to pointing and controlling, for example, virtual pointers on a screen and one of them are \todo[inline]{Again, begin inserting references to those papers here}
